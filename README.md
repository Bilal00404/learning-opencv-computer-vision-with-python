# Learning OpenCV and Computer Vision with Python

Welcome to my journey of learning OpenCV and computer vision using Python! This repository is a collection of scripts, and examples that I have created or gathered from various lectures and resources.

## Overview
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. With the help of Python, OpenCV can be used to process images, and videos, and perform a wide range of computer vision tasks. This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with OpenCV.

## Repository Structure
- Lectures/: Contains Python scripts for various OpenCV exercises and examples.
- img/: Images used in the scripts.
- videos/: Videos used in the scripts.


## Getting Started

To run the scripts in this repository, you'll need to set up a Python environment with OpenCV installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Bilal00404/learning-opencv-computer-vision-with-python.git

2. Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):
- python -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
- venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
